    <h1>A Closer Look at Flock Cameras</h1>
    <h3>The Promise of Safety vs. the Reality of Surveillance</h3>
</header>

<main>

<section class="intro">
    <p>
       Flock Safety's license plate reader (ALPR) systems are being rapidly deployed across the United States, marketed as a powerful tool to solve and prevent crime. Proponents, including many law enforcement agencies, tout their effectiveness in recovering stolen vehicles, catching wanted suspects, and reducing crime rates. However, a growing number of privacy advocates, civil liberties organizations, and concerned citizens are raising serious questions about the true cost of this technology. This page compiles information to shed light on the concerns surrounding the widespread use of Flock cameras.

        “Once this level of surveillance is normalized, it becomes incredibly hard to roll back.”
        — Jon McCray Jones, ACLU of Wisconsin

    <h2>Key Concerns</h2>

    <div class="concern-item">
        <h3>1. Mass Surveillance and Privacy Intrusion</h3>
        <p>
            Flock cameras capture data on every passing vehicle, not just suspected criminals.
            This includes license plates, vehicle make, model, color, and other identifiers,
            creating a permanent record of innocent people’s movements without consent.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="concern-item">
        <h3>2. Data Sharing and Mission Creep</h3>
        <p>
            Flock’s nationwide data-sharing network allows agencies to access information far beyond
            their jurisdiction. This has expanded usage into immigration enforcement and sensitive
            investigations unrelated to violent crime.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="concern-item">
        <h3>3. Misuse by Law Enforcement</h3>
        <p>
            Documented cases show officers using the system for personal reasons, including tracking
            former partners. Weak auditing mechanisms make abuse difficult to detect.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="concern-item">
        <h3>4. Errors and False Positives</h3>
        <p>
            Plate misreads and matching errors have resulted in innocent people being detained at gunpoint.
            These mistakes aren’t theoretical — they’ve already happened.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="concern-item">
        <h3>5. Lack of Oversight</h3>
        <p>
            Many cities deploy Flock systems without public debate or clear data-retention policies.
            Residents often don’t know where cameras are placed or how long their data is stored.
