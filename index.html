        <h1>A Closer Look at Flock Cameras</h1>
        <h3>The Promise of Safety vs. The Reality of Surveillance</h3>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section class="intro">
            <p>Flock Safety's license plate reader (ALPR) systems are being rapidly deployed across the United States, marketed as a powerful tool to solve and prevent crime. Proponents, including many law enforcement agencies, tout their effectiveness in recovering stolen vehicles, catching wanted suspects, and reducing crime rates. However, a growing number of privacy advocates, civil liberties organizations, and concerned citizens are raising serious questions about the true cost of this technology. This page compiles information to shed light on the concerns surrounding the widespread use of Flock cameras.</p>

            <h2>Key Concerns</h2>
            <div class="concern-item">
                <h3>1. Mass Surveillance and Privacy Intrusion</h3>
                <p>Flock cameras are not just for criminals; they capture data on every vehicle that passes by, creating a vast database of information on innocent people. This data can include not only license plates but also vehicle "fingerprints" such as make, model, color, and distinguishing features. This constant monitoring creates a digital trail of your daily movements—where you live, work, and visit—without your consent.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concern-item">
                <h3>2. Data Sharing and "Mission Creep"</h3>
                <p>While Flock and law enforcement agencies often state the data is for solving local, serious crimes, the reality is more complex. The company's national network allows agencies to share data across state lines, creating a national surveillance dragnet. This has led to the technology being used for purposes far beyond its stated intent, including for immigration enforcement by ICE and in cases related to abortion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concern-item">
                <h3>3. Potential for Misuse and Abuse</h3>
                <p>The system has been shown to be vulnerable to misuse by law enforcement. There have been documented cases of officers using the system to illegally track estranged spouses or for other personal, non-criminal purposes. The reliance on manual entry for audit logs and case numbers can also make it difficult to track and prevent such misuse.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concern-item">
                <h3>4. Errors and False Alarms</h3>
                <p>No technology is infallible. Errors in reading license plates can lead to false positives, resulting in innocent individuals being mistakenly flagged as suspects. These mistakes can have terrifying consequences, as evidenced by incidents where families, including children, were held at gunpoint by police due to a misread plate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concern-item">
                <h3>5. Lack of Regulation and Transparency</h3>
                <p>The rapid deployment of Flock cameras has outpaced meaningful public oversight and regulation. Often, the policies governing the use and retention of data are unclear or non-existent, varying significantly by jurisdiction. Community members are frequently left in the dark about how their data is being collected, stored, and used.</p>
